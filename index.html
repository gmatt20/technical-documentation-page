            In today's digital age, the internet stands at the forefront of
            modernity, revolutionizing the way we communicate, learn, work, and
            entertain. The internet allows for seamless connection to the entire
            globe like never before. It is as if the most basic necessity every
            human being needs is at least a smartphone, after acquiring basic
            needs first, to navigate the world. The internet brings unique
            opportunities that IRL otherwise would not have.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At the heart of this transformation are the fundamental technologies
            that power the web: HTML and CSS. These core building blocks enable
            us to create and style the webpages that form the fabric of our
            online experiences.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Role of HTML</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all web
            pages. It can be analogized as a skeleton for the website, where
            HTML provides the structures the content on the web, from text and
            images to links and multimedia. With HTML, we define the various
            elements that make up a webpage, ensuring that content is organized
            and accessible.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Role of CSS</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, brings the structure created by HTML
            to life with design and style. It allows us to control the
            appearance of our web pages, from layout and colors to fonts and
            spacing. Think of CSS like the skin, hair, colors, and fashion of a
            skeleton. CSS transforms a basic HTML document into a visually
            engaging experience, ensuring that websites are not only functional
            but also aesthetically pleasing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>HTML and CSS Together</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mastering HTML and CSS is essential for anyone looking to create
            websites or dive into web development. These technologies form the
            backbone of the web, and understanding them is crucial for building
            responsive, accessible, user-friendly, and incredible web pages.
            Whether you're a novice web developer, an apprentice programmer, a
            master developer, or someone with a passion for technology,
            knowledge of HTML and CSS is an invaluable asset.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>What Can You Build With HTML and CSS?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Just about anything you see on the world wide web. Examples of
            simple websites you can build when you finish the documentation
            include:
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Your personal website</li>
          <li>Blog websites</li>
          <li>Landing pages</li>
          <li>Professional websites for businesses and organizations</li>
          <br />
          <p>
            The possibilities are endless with only HTML and CSS. However, HTML
            and CSS only allows you to create static web pages, meaning that you
            are able to create websites for clients that wants to have an online
            presence where they want to present information, rather than having
            an interactive website. Restaurants and organizations are the most
            common examples of this, yet they will pay you so much money for
            your technical skills!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I noted that you can only build static websites. But later on, you
            will learn about how make static websites more interactive using
            JavaScript, a programming language used to make websites
            interactive. However, this is beyond the scope of the documentation
            page, therefore, learning HTML and CSS are crucial to understand the
            web page before diving into JS. HTML and CSS are prerequisites to
            JS.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Contents of The Documentation</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In this documentation, fundamental concepts and practical
            applications of HTML and CSS will be explored. Topics covered will

            that will help you build robust and visually appealing web pages.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There is no end to this journey. Once you start learning the
            fundamentals, you can not help yourself but keep learning and
            improving your craft. By the end of the documentation, you will have

            Before diving into HTML and CSS, it's helpful to have a basic
            understanding of some foundational concepts related to the web and
            how it functions. Make sure you learn these concepts beforehand.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The World Wide Web (WWW)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW) is a vast network of interconnected
            documents and resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. It allows
            users to access information on the internet through web browsers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Additonally, a web browser is a software application used to access
            and view websites. Common web browsers include Google Chrome,
            Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Internet</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The internet is a global network of computers, while the web is a
            collection of information accessed via the internet. A URL is the
            address of a resource on the web. It specifies the location of a web
            page or file and how to retrieve it. A HTTP (HyperText Transfer
            Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are protocols used to transfer
            data over the web. HTTPS includes encryption for security.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Website and Webpage</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            A website is a collection of related web pages located under a
            single domain name. Examples include personal blogs, e-commerce
            sites, and corporate websites. A webpage is a document on the web
            that can contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia. It is
            written in HTML and styled with CSS. You will start HTML and CSS by
            building simple web pages.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Text Editors and Development Tools</h3>
          <p>
            A text editor is a software application that allows you to write
            code. Popular text editors for web development include Visual Studio
            Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. For the purpose of this documentation,
            we will be using Visual Studio Code
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Web browsers come with built-in developer tools that help in
            inspecting and debugging HTML and CSS code. These tools are
            invaluable for web development. For the purpose of this
            documentation, we will be using Google Chrome.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Having a grasp of these foundational concepts will make learning
            HTML and CSS more manageable and enjoyable. As you start your
            journey into web development, remember that practice and
            experimentation are key to mastering these technologies. With a
            solid understanding of the basics, you'll be well-equipped to create
            and style your own web pages and websites.

        <article class="content-section">
          <p>Finally, HTML content to learn! We will begin by how HTML adds content to a website. Firstly, HTML uses elements to define certain things on the webpage. For example:</p>
          <br>
          <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
          <br>
          <p>These are just only several examples of elements, there are a vast majority of elements!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Elements are distinguished from normal text by "tags", meaning that the name of the element is surrounded by "&lt;" and "&gt;". To close a tag, you simply put a lash infront of the element closing tag, such as <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;html/&gt;</code>. If you do not close the element, it can lead to strange problems and behaviors. Within the element is the actual content, where you can put text.</p>

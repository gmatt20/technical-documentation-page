            <h3>Displays</h3>
            <p>
              The default page behavior is normal flow. Meaning that the page
              always starts out with either as blocks or inlines. The mindset
              when it comes to making websites it is that we should work with
              the normal flow, rather than struggling against it (Kevin Powell).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It is crucial to understand the basics; inline elements and block
              elements.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
            <p>
              Inline elements only use as much horizontal space as their content
              requires. Therefore, inline elements are not greedy. Inline
              elements do not start on a new line.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Block Elements</h3>
            <p>
              Block elements takes up the entire horizontal space it is allowed
              to get. Therefore, block elements not greedy and will take the
              full width of the screen. Block elements start on a new line.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Now, here are the other displays:</p>
            <br />
            <h3>
              <a
                class="link flex-link"
                href="https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/"
                target="_blank"
                >Flex</a
              >
            </h3>
            <p>
              The flex property is used to create a flexible layout, which
              allows a natural responsive web design. Think of a flex container
              like a row or column of blocks that you can easily move around,
              resize, and align in different ways. This makes creating complex
              layouts much easier compared to traditional methods.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Inline-Block</h3>
            <p>
              The inline-block property allows an element to behave like an
              inline element while still retaining block element
              characteristics. They are laid out in a line, just like inline
              elements. They respect whitespace in the HTML, meaning spaces,
              tabs, and line breaks between inline-block elements in the source
              code will affect the rendered output.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Unlike purely inline elements, inline-block elements can have
              width and height set. They can have padding, margins, and borders
              applied, which will affect the layout just as with block elements.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You can place multiple inline-block elements next to each other on
              the same line, making it useful for creating layouts like
              navigation bars, buttons, or image galleries without the need for
              floats. It is useful for creating responsive layouts without using
              floats or flexbox/grid.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Grid</h3>
            <p>
              The grid property displays an element as a block-level grid
              container. The Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system,
              meaning it can handle both rows and columns. It allows you to
              define a grid structure and place items into this grid, providing
              more control over the alignment and spacing of elements compared
              to traditional layout methods like floats or flexbox.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Inherit</h3>
            <p>Inherits this property from its parent element.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>None</h3>
            <p>The element disappears.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>Box Model</h2>
            <p>
              The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are
              generated for elements in the document tree and laid out
              according. to the visual formatting model.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The content box contains the actual content. Size it using
              inline-size and block-size, or:
            </p>
            <code>width</code>
            <code>height</code>
            <p>The padding box is the area around the content pox.</p>
            <code>padding</code>
            <p>The border box wraps the content and padding.</p>
            <code>border</code>
            <p>
              The margin box is the outermost layer which wraps the border,
              padding, and content.
            </p>
            <code>margin</code>
            <br />
            <p>
              One more thing, in normal flow, the page uses content-box
              box-sizing. Content-box defines how the width and height of an
              element are calculated: should they include padding and borders,
              or not. The width and height you set on an element apply only to
              the content box. Padding, border, and margin are added outside of
              the content box.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The border-box model includes padding and border in the element's
              width and height. The width and height you set on an element
              include the content, padding, and border. Only the margin is added
              outside of this total width and height.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Always set border-box globally.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
              Responsive web design makes web pages render well on a variety of
              devices and window or screen sizes.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Use flexible units (%, vh, vw, em, rem) for more responsiveness
              rather than using absolute units.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Extra small devices (600px and down)</p>
            <code> @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} </code>
            <p>Small devices (600px and up)</p>
            <code> @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...} </code>
            <p>Medium devices (768px and up)</p>
            <code> @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...} </code>
            <p>Large devices (992px and up) (768px and up)</p>
            <code> @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...} </code>
            <p>Extra large devices (1200px and up)</p>
            <code> @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...} </code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>Selectors</h2>
            <p>
              Selectors are used to target specific elements in the HTML to
              style. Selectors can target elements, classes, and IDs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Here are 2 more advanced selectors:</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              ::after inserts something after the content of each selected
              element.
            </p>
            <code>::after</code>
            <br />
            <p>
              ::before inserts something before the content of each selected
              element.
            </p>
            <code>::before</code>
            <br />
            <p>
              These 2 selectors are paired with content: " "; to insert any
              content. Further, you can style the content like any normal
              element.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              These 2 selectors great for adding more decorations (icons before
              or after a element without needing another element for it), adding
              quotes, displaying custom list bullets, create tooltips, etc.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are also pseudo classes which is used to define a special
              state of an element. Here are user action pseudo-classes:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>:hover activates when the mouse pointer points over the item.</p>
            <code>:hover</code>
            <br />
            <p>
              :active activates when an item is being activated by the user. For
              example, when the item is clicked on.
            </p>
            <code>:active</code>
            <br />
            <p>Next, here are functional pseudo-classes:</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The matches-any pseudo-class matches any element that matches any
              of the selectors in the list provided.
            </p>
            <code>:is()</code>
            <br />
            <p>
              The negation, or matches-none, pseudo-class represents any element
              that is not represented by its argument.
            </p>
            <code>:not()</code>
            <br />
            <p>Finally, here are tree-structural pseudo-classes:</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Represents an element that is the root of the document. In HTML
              this is usually the &lt;html&gt; element.
            </p>
            <code>:root</code>
            <br />
            <p>Matches an element that is the first of its siblings.</p>
            <code>:first-child</code>
            <br />
            <p>Matches an element that is the last of its siblings.</p>
            <code>:last-child</code>
